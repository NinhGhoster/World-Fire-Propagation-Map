# Moving Firefighter Problem - Original Paper Implementation

This directory contains the original implementation of the Moving Firefighter Problem (MFP) from the research paper:

**Bruno R. Gutiérrez-De-La-Paz, Jesús García-Díaz, Rolando Menchaca-Méndez, Mauro A. Montenegro-Meza, Ricardo Menchaca-Méndez, Omar A. Gutiérrez-De-La-Paz. The Moving Firefighter Problem.**

## Overview

The Moving Firefighter Problem (MFP) is a generalization of the original Firefighter Problem presented by Hartnell. It incorporates a function τ that defines the time a firefighter takes to move from one vertex to another.

This implementation contains the mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) for the optimization version of the MFP for a single firefighter (1-MFP).

## Files Description

### Core Implementation
- **`miqcp.py`**: Main MIQCP formulation implementation
- **`miqcp_scip_alternative.py`**: Alternative implementation using SCIP solver
- **`run_batch.py`**: Runs the complete batch instances used in the article
- **`get_D_value.py`**: Finds an upper bound for the defense rounds D
- **`recursive_function.py`**: Finds the minimum value for the burning rounds B needed to achieve the optimal objective
- **`verify_function.py`**: Ensures that the diffusive process finishes for the defending rounds B

### Utilities and Results
- **`gens_for_paper.py`**: Contains the seeds used for the paper
- **`utils.py`** and **`plots.py`**: Responsible for the plotting process
- **`convert_to_cvs.py`**: Converts results to CSV format
- **`img/`**: Contains the plots generated by the plotting utilities
- **`Runs/`**: Contains the results obtained by running `run_batch.py`, which are reported in the paper

### Documentation
- **`Readme.md`**: Original README with installation and usage instructions

## Installation

To execute the implemented formulations, you need to install Gurobi:

### Step 1: Download and install Anaconda
Gurobi supports Python 2.7 and 3.7 for Windows. However, to run our code install Python 3.X.

### Step 2: Install Gurobi into Anaconda
From an Anaconda terminal, issue the following command to add the Gurobi channel to your default search list:
```
$ conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi
```

Now issue the command to install the Gurobi package:
```
$ conda install gurobi
```

### Step 3: Install a Gurobi License
The third step is to install a Gurobi license (if you haven't already done so).

## Moving Firefighter Problem Generator

## Usage

Run `run_batch.py`. Feel free to change the hyperparameters. Be careful because a more considerable number of nodes in a graph or a smaller lambda value could mean a more considerable running time.

The results are saved in `./Runs/csv_s` directory as CSV files divided by the number of nodes in the graph.
